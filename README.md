openxlsx
========
This [R](https://www.R-project.org/) package simplifies the
creation of `.xlsx` files by providing 
a high level interface to writing, styling and editing
worksheets. Through the use of
[`Rcpp`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp), 
read/write times are comparable to the
[`xlsx`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xlsx)
and
[`XLConnect`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XLConnect)
packages with the added benefit of removing the dependency on
Java.
